Decoding the Dress Code ðŸ‘—: Deep Learning for Automated Fashion Item Detection

My ML3 Project at Asian Institute of Management

This is a complete pipeline demonstrating automated fashion item detection (Multiple Object Detection) using Hugging Face datasets and pretrained models, Pytorch Lightning, and Fashionpedia Dataset.

Refer to the ML3_FashionProject_Final.ipynb for the complete code. For the model, you may download it from this link: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1iAcZv3nndPcRkDKDhAx4itUTFuBzaNFU/view?usp=sharing (file too big to upload here).

I also created a blog related to this. You may read it here: https://medium.com/@erikaglacson/decoding-the-dress-code-deep-learning-for-automated-fashion-item-detection-a1ce61acfe33
